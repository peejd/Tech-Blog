# Tech Blog


## Description

This bulletin-style Tech Blog was built for the Module 14 homework challenge for the Coding Bootcamp and UNC Chapel Hill.


In its current iteration, it does not quite meet all of the Acceptance Criteria of the assignment, however it does at least render the list of blog posts via the Routes and using the Handlebars views and SQL / Sequelize data models and includes a Login page.
